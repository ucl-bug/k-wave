function affine = getAffineMatrix(translation, rotation)
%GETAFFINEMATRIX Return matrix for affine transform in 3D.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%     getAffineMatrix returns an affine matrix defined by the specified
%     translation and rotation. 
%
% USAGE:
%     affine = getAffineMatrix(translation, rotation)
%
% INPUTS:
%     translation         - translation given as [dx, dy] in 2D and 
%                           [dx, dy, dz] in 3D
%     rotation            - rotation angle/s in degrees given as 
%                           [th] in 2D (counter-clockwise)and 
%                           [x_th, y_th, z_th] in 3D (rotate about x
%                           then y' then z'') [degrees] 
%
% OUTPUTS:
%     affine              - affine transformation matrix
